      <h3> Structured Programming </h3>

      <p> 
        Structured Programming expands the studentâ€™s knowledge of programming
concepts in the context of a programming language and its
integrated development environment. It includes algorithm
implementation, use of the debugger, and test driven development. It explores program maintenance and self-documenting code as well as using program comments properly.
In addition, this course continues to develop basic problem
solving analysis and critical thinking skills that aid the student when developing algorithms. 
      </p>


      <h3> Object Oriented Programming </h3>

      <p> This course introduces Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in a programming language using a compatible integrated development environment. It includes the
        principles of OOP; encapsulation, polymorphism, reusable
        code, inheritance, composition, and abstraction. OOP also
        introduces graphical user interfaces and teaches the student
        how to properly create an OO graphical user interface. In
        addition, this course continues to develop basic problem
        solving analysis and critical thinking skills that aid the student when developing algorithms. 
      </p>

      <h3> Networking</h3>
      <p> 
        This course is designed to provide the student with working
knowledge of the basic building blocks of a network, The
course emphasizes the OSI Model; a world-wide standard
for networks. Topics will include Transmission, Networking Media, the TCP/IP Protocol Suite, Network Topologies
(physical and logical), Ethernet Technology, Networking
Hardware (NICs, hubs, switches, bridges, and routers), and
Wireless Technologies. Significant emphasis will be placed
on TCP/IP, specifically, topics such as the IP protocol, IP addressing, and DHCP. In our network lab, students will get to
view working network devices such as switches and routers
and use various utilities to complete labs that involve analyzing live network settings and network performance. 
      </p>

   
      <h3> Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>
          This course provides an introduction to the design and
implementation of operating systems. It is intended for
students with a basic background in computing systems.
The first portion of the course presents the basic concepts
of operating systems, which are platform independent. The
second portion of the course covers specific issues with four
operating systems in widespread use today. Topics covered include: concurrent processes, resource management, deadlocks, memory management, virtual memory, processor
scheduling, disk scheduling, file systems, distributed file systems, micro kernels, multiprocessor operating system issues,
and case studies.
        </p>

        <h3> Senior Seminar</h3>

        <p>
          This capstone course integrates and synthesizes the various
          courses within the major or minor. Students will bring together the comprehensive knowledge of the technical functions of technology with the theoretical aspects. Students
          will use the concepts and theories they have studied to
          demonstrate mastery of skills by creating a unique project
          that integrates their knowledge into one project. Students
          will be reflective of past learning; they will determine how
          it can be applied within their field of study as well as how
          it fits into society and the liberal arts. Students will demonstrate expertise within their field. 
        </p>
