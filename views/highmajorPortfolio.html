      <p>     Highmajor is an application that
        I have been creating. It is focused on
        helping underrecruited high school 
        athletes get noticed by college coaches
        across all three levels. Many recruiting
        services charge consumers hundreds 
        and sometimes even thousands of dollars
        to use. Many athletes come from families
        that cannot afford these prices which 
        sometimes causes them to go unnoticed 
         Highmajor will be a free-to-use service
        for these athletes. The app will be similar 
        to Instagram where users can easily connect 
        with each other which will help athletes get
        noticed. This application is currently in 
        development and I am hoping to have it 
        completed by Summer 2021.
