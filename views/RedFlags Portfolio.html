      <p>Red Flags is a clothing brand that my best friend and I have started.
        Both of us have always had a major interest in fashion and have decided to 
        work together on this project. I also felt that starting a small business like 
        this would be good practice for me since I am interested in creating my own
        mobile application. I have so far learned a few skills in digital and social media
        marketing as well as product development. Working on this project has also 
        showed me the importance of building a strong relationship with customers.
        I feel that these skills will be very important when it is time for me to launch my 
        mobile application.
